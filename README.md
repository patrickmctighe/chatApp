My chat application utilizes WebSocket server technology and MongoDB, enhanced by the flexibility of Tailwind CSS and the functionality of Express.js. Within the platform, users can exchange messages and attachments in real-time with other participants. This project represents my endeavor to create an intuitive and efficient means of communication, offering a personalized experience for connecting and sharing within the application.
